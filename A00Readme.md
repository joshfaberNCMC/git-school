I have spent a lot of time with computers but I've raley gotten into the technical side of them. This is essentially my first attempt at a lot of this and I don't even really care about the bonus points, I just wanted to see how much of it I was actually able to teach myself and I'm pretty happy with where I ended got with it. I wasn't able to get absolutely everything but I was very thourough and I hope that counts for something at least.
